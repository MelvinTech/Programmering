Rogue: Devolved

Welcome to the end! Inside you will face your demons, real demons and tiny creatures of the mist.
If your quest is of noble cause you will find no problem fighting in the light. 
But beware, the creatures you will face in here are not of the light for they feed on darkness 
Defeating the powers of the dark are not a simple task and 
you are not the first on to try and you shall not be the last.

Before you enter, I must know your name, for if you succeed it 
shall be one long remembered in tales of your valour.
