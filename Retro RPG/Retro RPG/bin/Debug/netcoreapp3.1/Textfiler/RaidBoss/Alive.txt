						You enter a massive throneroom with a large throne in the 
						middle decorated with the most precious of metals. 
						The walls of the room are mostly empty except for the 
						huge amount of ornate stone doors lining them.

						Upon the throne sits a figure clad in black armour emitting 
						a cold blue glow. The figure grabs his massive black 
						battleaxe and starts to speak, "You have entered the 
						chamber of the doomslayer, here you will find what it 
						is you seek or you will perish!"

						What do you do?
