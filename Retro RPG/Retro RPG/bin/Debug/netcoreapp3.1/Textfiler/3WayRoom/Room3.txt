						A massive baracks lay before you, a huge amount of doors fill 
						the corridor all of which lead in to smaller rooms full 
						of beds chests and weaponracks, there are however no
						weapons in the racks, no clothes in the chests and mysteriously 
						no sign that anyone had ever been there.You do however notice a 
						large amount of footspeps on the dustcovered floor, 
						all of them leading towards a large ornate stone door. 
						You try to push the door open but you find that it must be
						blocked from the other side. There are three less appealing 
						doors that are not blocked.
