						You enter a large room remenicent of a kitchen. 
						Woodfueled stoves still crackle as if
						there was someone still using after all this time. 
						There are three doors, two made of rotting wood and 
						one ornate stone with gold inlays. 
						The ornate door is locked from the other side.
