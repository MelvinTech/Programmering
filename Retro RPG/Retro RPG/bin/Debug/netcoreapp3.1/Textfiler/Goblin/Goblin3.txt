						You enter what seems to be some sort of small kitchen. 
						A woodfueled stove sits in the corner with embers flying 
						everywhere and on top of it lies a large pot that 
						smells terrible. You hear a disgruntled grunt from behind 
						you and when you turn around you see a goblin with a 
						large knife standing in the doorway. There is a path behind you.

						What do you do?
