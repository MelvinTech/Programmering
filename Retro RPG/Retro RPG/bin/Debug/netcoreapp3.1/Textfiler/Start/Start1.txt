Rogue: Devolved

Welcome to the dungeon! What you will meet within I cannot say.
Will you meet your maker or will you see your way through the darkness?
Before you enter you must know that reaching a satisfying ending is 
difficult and time consuming. You will not do on your first try!

What name do you want on your tombstone?
